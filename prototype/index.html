        The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) is a public research university in Little Rock,
        Arkansas. Established as Little Rock Junior College by the Little Rock School District in 1927, the institution
        became a private four-year university under the name Little Rock University in 1957. It returned to public status
        in 1969 when it merged with the University of Arkansas System under its present name. The former campus of Little
        Rock Junior College is now the campus of Philander Smith University.
